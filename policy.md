If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.
 

### PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS
You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or text messages by following the instructions in those emails or by responding “STOP” or “OPT OUT” in response to text messages. If you opt out, we may still send you other types of emails and communications, such as those about your use of the Sites or any donations or transactions. Please note that opt-out requests may not take effect immediately and may take a reasonable amount of time to receive, process, and apply, during which time your information shall remain subject to your prior privacy settings. Further, please note that (unless required by applicable law) we may not be able to retrieve or rescind any information provided to third parties prior to your election to opt out.
